## Basic JavaScript


**JavaScript** is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

## SASS#
Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.

In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more.
